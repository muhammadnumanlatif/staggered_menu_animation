# staggered_menu_animation

1-Create the menu without animations

2-Prepare for animations

3-Animate the list items and button

4-Interactive example


A single app screen might contain multiple animations. Playing all of the animations at the same time can be overwhelming. Playing the animations one after the other can take too long. A better option is to stagger the animations. Each animation begins at a different time, but the animations overlap to create a shorter duration. In this recipe, you build a drawer menu with animated content that is staggered and has a button that pops in at the bottom.
